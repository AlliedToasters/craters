CRATER DETECTION PROJECT

This is my capstone project for the Thinkful data science course. My objective is to apply experimentally successful crater detection algorithms (CDA) into an easy-to-use, extensible CDA python package.

My current proposal is to build a two-step pipeline:

step 1: Generate crater proposals
step 2: Classify crater proposals as craters or non-craters

The pipeline will return a set of vetted crater proposals given an input image. Take a look at the proposal:
