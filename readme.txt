CRATER DETECTION PROJECT

The goal of this project is to improve automated crater detection techniques. I plan to use convolutional neural nets with computer vision techniques to address one of, or potentially both, persisting problems in crater surveying software:

1) Automatic Crater Detection
2) Crater Proposal Classification (Crater/Not a Crater classification)

Both of these problems have been explored most recently (2010 and onward) on a particular dataset, found here: https://github.com/ieee8023/CraterDataset

I am currently working on a project proposal that will outline my approach. That proposal will be pushed to this repository when ready.
