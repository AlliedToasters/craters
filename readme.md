# Crater Detection Capstone Project

This repository contains some of the work that went in to building the models I use at the core of <a href='https://github.com/AlliedToasters/PyCDA'>PyCDA</a>. Take a look at my <a href='https://github.com/AlliedToasters/craters/blob/master/CapstoneNotebook.ipynb'>Capstone Project Notebook</a> for a coherent story about the way I built this python package for crater detection.

## PyCDA

<a href='https://github.com/AlliedToasters/PyCDA'>PyCDA</a> is an open source crater detection framework designed to make crater detection simple. The alpha version is now available for download via pip:

```
pip install pycda
```

Take a look!
